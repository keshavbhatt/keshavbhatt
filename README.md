I'm Keshav Bhatt an independent, Open-source application developer from the northern region of India.

My main focus since introduced to FOSS is on developing applications targeting Linux Desktop Operating systems. I have been using FOSS since I was in 10th grade since year 2010, the first OS which attracted my focus toward application development was Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat. 

Most of my work can be found on(not limited to) these locations:

- [Ktechpit](http://ktechpit.com): Website I use to publish work that I am doing and about other random stuff

Currently, I work at [@Zextras](https://github.com/Zextras) as Software Developer. Zextras is known for providing Private, Secure E-mail and Collaboration suite to the world and is commited to provide its users the freedom and ownership of their data that they deserve in corporate communication.
