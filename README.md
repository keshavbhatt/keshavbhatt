 My name is Keshav Bhatt. I am a independent, Free, Open-source application developer from the northern region of India from state Uttarakhand.

My main focus since I was introduced to FOSS is on developing applications targeting Linux Desktop Operating systems. I have been using FOSS since I was in 10th grade in the year 2010, the first OS which attracted my focus toward application development was Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.

  Interesting, show me more

I completed my graduation in Biological Science (B.Sc) in the year 2015 and had a professional graduate degree in Education (B.Ed) in the year 2019. Currently, I am pursuing my post-graduation degree in Chemistry (M.Sc). I also have a foundation level diploma in Computer Applications ‘O’ Level by  [NIELIT](http://www.nielit.gov.in/). So, am not an IT professional with any sort of academic background in Computer Science.

I was fascinated by computer science in my childhood and when I got introduced to FOSS my fascination turned into my hobby and I have no plans to look back now. This is the same reason why I got this opportunity to introduce myself with you guys here through this nice platform.
